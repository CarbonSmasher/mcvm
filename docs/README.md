# MCVM Documentation
This is the simple Markdown documentation for MCVM.

- [Configuring](configuring.md)
- [Modifications](modifications.md)
- [Packages](packages/packages.md)
- [Game Options](game_options.md)
- [Principles](principles.md)

Documentation for the CLI can be found by running `mcvm help`. Examples for the library can be found in the code for the CLI, as it is a simple implementation of all the functionality. All library crates should have code documentation hosted on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs).
